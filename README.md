## Get Manga

This is a simple script to download manga chapter images from [MangaReader][dl] site. I made this for my personal use. So, its pretty simple. 

[dl]: http://www.mangareader.net

The params are to be given in the source file itself (after __END__ section).

Features : 

* Multi Threaded downloads
* Multiple chapter numbers can be specified.
* Should work across OSs. Have tested this with both windows and mac osx. 

Fill the params in the source code file and run the script as
>ruby getmanga.rb
